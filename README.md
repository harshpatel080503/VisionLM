## üåü Introduction
**VisionLM**  is a hybrid model that leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Transformer-based language model for generating natural language descriptions. It can handle tasks such as:

- Image Captioning
- Visual Question Answering (VQA)
- Image-Text Retrieval
- Multimodal Understanding
This project is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing researchers and developers to fine-tune it on custom datasets.
