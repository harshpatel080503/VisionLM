# 🧠 VisionLM - A Vision Language Model
**VisionLM** is a PyTorch implementation of a vision-language model designed for image-captioning, visual question answering, and other tasks that integrate computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). VisionLM combines state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer architectures to achieve high performance across multiple datasets.

## 🌟 Introduction
**VisionLM**  is a hybrid model that leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Transformer-based language model for generating natural language descriptions. It can handle tasks such as:

- Image Captioning
- Visual Question Answering (VQA)
- Image-Text Retrieval
- Multimodal Understanding
This project is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing researchers and developers to fine-tune it on custom datasets.

## 🚀 Features
- **CNN-Transformer Hybrid Architecture**: Combines the power of convolutional layers for visual understanding with the Transformer model for language generation.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Supports using pre-trained vision models (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.) and language models (BERT, GPT, etc.).
- **Custom Datasets**: Easily plug-and-play with custom datasets for specific vision-language tasks.
- **Multiple Vision-Language Tasks**: Supports a range of tasks like image captioning, VQA, and retrieval.
- **Flexible Training Configurations**: Fine-tune or train VisionLM from scratch with various hyperparameters.
